# Red 5 Heatmap

## Requirements
- python 2.x/3.x
- virtualenv
- mongodb

## Vagrant
This app makes use of [Vagrant]() and [VirtualBox]() for local development but neither are required.  The default provision provides a 64 bit Ubuntu box that should come preinstalled with everything you need to run the included Django app.  Simply `vagrant up` and then navigate to the `/vagrant` directory

## Installation
